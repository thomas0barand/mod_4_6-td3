        "Transformers have been introduced by [Vaswani et al. in 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in the context of NLP (Natural Language Processing), and particulary for Machine Translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its great success has led to its adaptation to various applications, including image classification. In this trend, [Dosovitskiy et al. in 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) have proposed Vision Transformers (ViT) that we will study and implement from scratch in this TD.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each such sub-image goes through a linear embedding. From then, each sub-image becomes a one-dimensional vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "A positional embedding is then added to these vectors (tokens). The positional embedding allows the network to know where each sub-image is positioned originally in the image. Without this information, the network would not be able to know where each such image would be placed, leading to potentially wrong predictions!\n",
        "\n",
        "These tokens are then passed, together with a special classification token, to the transformer encoders blocks, were each is composed of : A Layer Normalization (LN), followed by a Multi-head Self Attention (MSA) and a residual connection. Then a second LN, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and again a residual connection. These blocks are connected back-to-back.\n",
        "\n",
